Due to its size, the center of the park will be used as reference for its location. The latitude and longitude were already identified using Google maps and is -23.588375, -46.658258.\nWith the latitude and longitude of the park, the closest food venues will be identified through Foursquare API, with a radius of 2500 meters. This large radius was chosen due the size of the park. With a 2500 radius, we will assure that at least a five-block radius surrounding the park will be considered when looking for food venues. ",

A cluster analysis will be performed using the latitude and longitude of the venues to identify regions with lower density of food venues. The clusters will be plotted through using folium to make the visualization easier. If there is a low density region, the categories of the venues will be reviewed to see what are the most popular food types and a recommendation of a type of restaurant will be made based on the other types of restaurants available in the region selected.",
